The purpose of this app is to use node.js to call API's and use the information called in those API's.
The API's used in this application are Twitter, Spotify and OMDB.
To use this app type node liri and a command "tweet-this", "spotify-this", or "omdb-movie" followed by a search for one of the commands. For example node liri tweet-this ladygaga. This will search the twitter API for the last 10 tweets from lady gaga.
If you do not type in a search for example: node liri, this will run my read file and auto fill your command with an appropriate search for each API.
Finally to use my read file you can type in the console node liri "do-this" and it will use all API calls in the application again using my read file.
